    >Adds five tiers of artificial grow lights representing real-world lighting evolution:
Incandescent → Halogen → High Pressure Sodium → LED Mk I → Advanced LED Array.

Each tier progressively improves light radius and energy efficiency, while generating
heat proportional to its inefficiency. Earlier lamps run hot; LED tiers run cool.
Unlocked through a dedicated five-stage research chain.

No DLC required. No Harmony patches.</description>
