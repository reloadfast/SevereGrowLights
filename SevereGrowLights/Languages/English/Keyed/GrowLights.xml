  SevereGrowLights – Languages/English/Keyed/GrowLights.xml

  Keyed strings are for UI text referenced by C# code via Translate().
  Because this mod is XML-only (no C# code), there are no keyed strings
  required at this time.

  All grow lamp and research labels/descriptions are defined inline within
  their respective ThingDefs and ResearchProjectDefs.

  Translators working on other languages should create:
    Languages/<Language>/DefInjected/ThingDef/GrowLights.xml
    Languages/<Language>/DefInjected/ResearchProjectDef/GrowLightResearch.xml
  and mirror the <label> and <description> fields from the English defs.
