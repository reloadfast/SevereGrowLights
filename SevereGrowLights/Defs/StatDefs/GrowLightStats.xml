  SevereGrowLights – StatDefs/GrowLightStats.xml

  Defines one custom stat used by all grow lamp ThingDefs:
    SGL_LightEfficiency – the fraction of electrical input converted to
    photosynthetically useful light (remainder is waste heat).
    Displayed as a percentage in the building info card.

  Values by tier (hardcoded in each ThingDef's statBases):
    Incandescent   0.30  (30%)
    Halogen        0.40  (40%)
    Sodium         0.50  (50%)
    LED Mk I       0.70  (70%)
    LED Red        0.65  (65%)  – red-biased; more IR waste
    LED Blue       0.75  (75%)  – blue-biased; less IR waste
    Advanced LED   0.85  (85%)

    <description>The proportion of electrical power converted to useful plant-growth light rather than waste heat. Higher values mean less heat generated per watt consumed. LED technology achieves dramatically higher efficiency than filament or discharge lamp predecessors.</description>
